The database is structured as follows:

= Instructions:

== Rank films by length 

* (filter out the rows that have nulls or 0s in length column). In your output, only select the columns title, length, and the rank.


`*_Answer:_*`

```sql
SELECT
    title,
    `length`,
    rank() over(
        ORDER BY
            `length` DESC
    ) AS ranking
FROM
    film
WHERE
    `length` != 0
    OR NOT NULL;
```

== Rank films by length within the rating category 

* (filter out the rows that have nulls or 0s in length column). In your output, only select the columns title, length, rating and the rank.

`*_Answer:_*`

```sql
SELECT
    title,
    `length`,
    rating,
    dense_rank() over(
        ORDER BY
            `length` DESC
    ) AS ranking
FROM
    film
WHERE
    `length` NOT IN (0, '', ' ')
ORDER BY
    3;
```

== How many films are there for each of the categories in the category table?

* Use appropriate join to write this query

`*_Answer:_*`

```sql
SELECT
    a.`name` AS film_category,
    count(b.film_id) AS number_of_films
FROM
    category a
    INNER JOIN film_category b ON a.category_id = b.category_id
GROUP BY
    1
ORDER BY
    2 DESC;
```

== Which actor has appeared in the most films?

`*_Answer:_*`

```sql
SELECT
    concat((a.first_name), ' ', (a.last_name)) actor_name,
    count(b.film_id) AS actors_appearances
FROM
    actor a
    INNER JOIN film_actor b ON a.actor_id = b.actor_id
GROUP BY
    1
ORDER BY
    2 DESC
LIMIT
    1;
```

== Most active customer 

* (the customer that has rented the most number of films)

`*_Answer:_*`

```sql
SELECT
    concat((a.first_name), ' ', (a.last_name)) customer_name,
    count(b.rental_id) AS rented_films
FROM
    customer a
    INNER JOIN rental b ON a.customer_id = b.customer_id
GROUP BY
    1
ORDER BY
    2 DESC
LIMIT
    1;
```

== Find which is the most rented film

* The answer is Bucket Brotherhood This query might require using more than one join statement. Give it a try. We will talk about queries with multiple join statements later in the lessons.

`*_Answer:_*`

```sql
SELECT
    b.title,
    count(c.rental_id) AS number_of_rents
FROM
    inventory a
    INNER JOIN film b ON a.film_id = b.film_id
    INNER JOIN rental c ON a.inventory_id = c.inventory_id
GROUP BY
    1
ORDER BY
    2 DESC
LIMIT
    1;
```

[TIP]
====
To do any join, I find it helpful to think of it as a 3 step process:

* Step 1: To think or draw the actual table we require as an outcome. In my case, I draw them if they join several tables.

Then build the SELECT statement: This is where we define the actual layout of the table, the order in which the columns are in the table from left to right and using the aggregations and functions if need be.

* Step 2 is to map how we will get from table A to table B, C, or D. To have a logical path that links the tables. Here we see which primary keys and foreign keys will help us do so.

* Step 3: We filter and sort the information we select with the WHERE, Group By, Having and Order by clauses. Note that in some cases, the query that we have just built becomes a sub-query, so we can refine the outcome to fit what we ask.

[#img-join]
.A triple inner join. Notice how the tables are connected so we could build our join. The film table is connected to the inventory table, then from another key it links to the rental table. This interactive EDR is a very useful feature of MySQL Workbench.
