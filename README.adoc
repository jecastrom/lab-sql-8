    `length`,
    rank() over(
        ORDER BY

    ) AS ranking
FROM

WHERE
    `length` != 0

    `length`,
    rating,
    dense_rank() over(

== How many films are there for each of the categories in the category table?

* Use appropriate join to write this query

`*_Answer:_*`

```sql
SELECT
    a.`name` AS film_category,
    count(b.film_id) AS number_of_films
FROM
    category a
    INNER JOIN film_category b ON a.category_id = b.category_id
GROUP BY
    1
ORDER BY
    2 DESC;
```

```mysqls
SELECT
    concat((a.first_name), ' ', (a.last_name)) actor_name,
    count(b.film_id) AS actors_appearances
FROM

    INNER JOIN film_actor b ON a.actor_id = b.actor_id
GROUP BY
    1
ORDER BY

* (the customer that has rented the most number of films)

`*_Answer:_*`

```sql

```

image::path[width=800]

== Find which is the most rented film
