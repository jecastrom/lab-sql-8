= Activity 1

* In this activity, we will be using the table `district` from the `bank` database and according to the description for the different columns:

** A4: no. of inhabitants
** A9: no. of cities
** A10: the ratio of urban inhabitants
** A11: average salary
** A12: the unemployment rate

== Rank districts by different variables

`*_Answer:_*`


** A4: no. of inhabitants

```sql
SELECT
    a2 AS district_name,
    a4 AS no_of_inhabitants,
    rank() over(
        ORDER BY
            a4 DESC
    ) AS ranking
FROM
    district;
```

** A9: no. of cities



```sql
SELECT
    a2 AS district_name,
    a9 AS no_of_cities,
    rank() over(
        ORDER BY
            a9 DESC
    ) AS ranking
FROM
    district;
```

[NOTE]
====
Notice that the number of cities can repeat or tie. When this occurs 
the two values receive the same ranking number, and then a gap is left 
in the ranking numbers. 

The Rank() functions uses a link:{rank-wiki}[Standard competition ranking strategy] (`1224` ranking). for example 
ranks in a "Olympic medalling style", if two people  share the gold, there is no 
silver medalist.footnote:[{fn-rank}]
 
If I didn't want a "gap" in the ranking numbers, then I should use the Dense_rank() 
function which uses a link:{drank-wiki}[Dense ranking strategy] (`1223` ranking)  so no olympic medalling style of ranking with Dense_rank(). In dense ranking, items that compare equally receive the same ranking number, and the next items receive the immediately following ranking number.footnote:[{fn-dense_rank}]
